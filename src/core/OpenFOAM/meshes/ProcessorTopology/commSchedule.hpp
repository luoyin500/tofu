Class
    Foam::commSchedule

Description
    Determines the order in which a set of processors should communicate
    with one another.

    The communication order should
      - have maximum overlap
      - allow blocking communication without deadlock

    Does a very simple scheduling which assumes same time for all operations.

    After construction:
      - schedule() gives the order in which the input communication should occur
      - procSchedule()[proci] gives per proci

    Does not care whether 'talking' is first send, second receive or maybe
    full swap. This is all responsibility of caller. See ProcessorTopology
    class for use in scheduling processor boundary swaps.
